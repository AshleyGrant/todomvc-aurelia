## Implementation

- following the getting started tutorial: http://aurelia.io/get-started.html
- attempt to go TDD where possible

### Open questions while developing

- <s>referencing jspm packages in ES6 only works easy through SystemJS (as with the mappings in `config.js`). But I didn't found a way to use those jspm-mappings without SystemJS. e.g. `import {Router} from 'aurelia-router';` won't work. :-(</s>
  - simply `require` the `config.js` after referencing the `jspm_packages/system.js`
- `Todos.filteredItems` getter is called infitely - why?

### Todos (I know...)

- merging in the original styles from TodoMVC
- missing local storage support
